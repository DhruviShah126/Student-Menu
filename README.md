# Student-Menu

In this project, I worked with base and derived classes. 
I created a Student class consisting of 3 possible types of students: history, math, and english. 
In the StudentList class, I created and managed an array of pointers which point to objects from the Student class. 
In the studentmain file, I implemented the StudentList class and created a menu allowing different options of ways you can itneract with a list of students including printing and sorting a list of student and generating a grade report based on an input of students and their grades on attendance, quizzes, projects, papers, midterms, and finals.
